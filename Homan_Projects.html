          <h4>Scratch Project</h4>
          <h1>Plumber Brothers Game</h1>
          <h6>September 2019, Computer Science Principles</h6>
          <p>The scratch project was an introductory project to establish the basics of coding. In this project, I pair programmed for the first time, which taught me about some aspects of team dynamics in coding projects. The objective of this project was to make either a story animation of a game, and my partner and I decided on making a game inspired by the Mario Brothers. As this project had little restrictions and itâ€™s main purpose was to get used to coding, my partner and I felt free to be very creative. To add plot to our story, we animated a beginning sequence to show a princess being stolen by an evil turtle. Before the last level, the player must jump on bricks, avoid holes, and pass the mini-villains which are usually mushrooms. In the last level, if all the obstacles and the turtle are defeated, the princess is freed from imprisonment and the characters get a happy ending. This project was short and while creating it I had beginner skills,  however, creating this app formed an integral part of my foundation in coding and I am pleased with the end product my partner and I created.

          <h4>Mit App Inventor Project</h4>
          <h1>Mole Mash</h1>
          <h6>September 2019 - October 2019, Computer Science Principles</h6>
          <p>In this project, my partner and I faced the task of renovating an app by adding our own innovative features to a game that was originally simple and basic. This app was developed in MIT App Inventor and we used a Mole Mash tutorial provided by MIT App Inventor as the starting point. The main function of the game was a mole popping up out of a hole and the player hitting it for a point. One of the first features we decided to add was a timer that limited the game to be thirty seconds long. Along with this timed version, I made a separate page that offered two levels: easy and difficult. In both the levels, the game lasted until the player lost all their lives. Lives were lost every time the mole moved without the player touching it. To create a harder level, we added more holes and a villain sprite that caused a life to be lost if it was touched. Overall, my partner and I worked very well, and after having experience from the Scratch project, I was able to create a product that I am proud of.</p>
