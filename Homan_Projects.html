        <h4>2022 Entrepreneurship Project</h4>
        <h1>Inclusifinder</h1>
        <h6>April - May 2022, AP Computer Science Applications</h6>
        <p>The purpose of the entrepreneurship project is to work with others to create a product that could be used in the real world. I enjoyed this project because of the creative freedom that the students are allowed and the challenge of making something with real world implications. For this year, my team and I decided to create an app called Inclusifinder that could help people with disabilities find jobs. First we used MIT App Inventor to create a prototype, and then we elevated it by creating a Greenfoot version in Java. I really appreciated this project because of the way it tackled ableism and how computing can be used for social good.

          <h4>Greenfoot Gameboard Project</h4>
          <h1>Arcade Boardgame</h1>
          <h6>August - September 2021, AP Computer Science Principles</h6>
          <p>This was one of the first projects I did in AP CSA. This program was created in Greenfoot and was completely coded in java. The project had loose parameters to make a boardgame that had automated movement, dice, question cards, and user input, which were all requirements the project met. This game was hard to create because it was the largest program in java that I had ever attempted to make and my partenrs and I didn't feel super comfortable in the language yet. I learned a lot during this project because I had to take a lot of time to do a lot of research in order to expand my knowledge of object oriented programming. In the end, I was extremely proud of this project because my team hit all the requirements, but we also implemented cool graphics and extra bonuses to our game such as special squares on the board that advance a player.

        <h4>Upcycling Project</h4>
        <h1>Backyard Scenery Co.</h1>
        <h6>February - March 2021, Principles of Engineering</h6>
        <p>The objective of this project was to make a line of products out of recyclable materials. Many common items are made of materials that are not recyclable or even perishable, putting a great strain on the environment. However, this project proved that engineering skills can be used to come up with environmentally friendly solutions and products. I worked virtually in a team of three and took on the role of the project manager, meaning I led the team and organized our meetings and plans for the overall project. The material restraints and the virtual aspects of this project created difficulties because there was less support from school and team members to execute this project. Our team ended up deciding to focus our products on backyard decorations, ultimately creating an eco-friendly line of a bird feeder, wind chime, and water fountain. I was the one who made the water fountain, which I am most proud of because it can run without any electricity or water pump.

          <h4>Rube Goldberg Compound Machine Project</h4>
          <h1>Santa Catchinator</h1>
          <h6>November - December 2020, Principles of Engineering</h6>
          <p>This was the first big project I did in Principles of Engineering and the objective was to build a machine made of household objects that could lift a 250 lb ‘Santa’. I worked in a team of four and acted as the project manager, which had its difficulties as a virtual project. As a leader, I learned to manage the time we spent on each portion of the project and organized meetings and group chats so we could communicate despite the distance. This project’s goal was to make a large compound machine that demonstrated our knowledge of simple machines, each team member built a quarter portion of the machine. It was particularly difficult to design and build the machine without the team members being able to see each other and connect each portion. In the end, I was able to bring the team together and spend extra time to make sure the entire machine ran smoothly and all our deliverables were complete and on time. The machine created was named the “Santa Catchinator” because it successfully uses 12 simple machines to lift a man two feet into the air.

        <h4>Image Manipulation Project</h4>
        <h1>Fun Family Photos!</h1>
        <h6>March - April 2020, Computer Science Principles</h6>
        <p>This project was the first project I did while in quarantine. Adjusting to working at home on my own was a big struggle, and coping with the lack of my peers and teachers made this project much harder to complete. However, I was able to persevere and try my best to complete this project with the resources I had. For this project, I used the Python Image Library to manipulate pictures. The task I choose was to create a standard frame for a family client. I decided on creating a collage of family photos to make the photo more interesting. One of the requirements for the photo was to include geometric shapes, so I used the Image Draw Module to draw on circles and squares around the border. At first, it was to difficult to navigate the documentation for the modules I was using, but I eventually got the hang of using photo manipulation modules. Also, another requirement I met was allowing the client to make choices, such as they are able to choose what shape they have on the border. Lastly, I pasted a heart as a symbol for the family and I altered the colors of the photo to make it more pleasing to the eye.

          <h4>Mit App Inventor Project</h4>
          <h1>Mole Mash</h1>
          <h6>September 2019 - October 2019, Computer Science Principles</h6>
          <p>In this project, my partner and I faced the task of renovating an app by adding our own innovative features to a game that was originally simple and basic. This app was developed in MIT App Inventor and we used a Mole Mash tutorial provided by MIT App Inventor as the starting point. The main function of the game was a mole popping up out of a hole and the player hitting it for a point. One of the first features we decided to add was a timer that limited the game to be thirty seconds long. Along with this timed version, I made a separate page that offered two levels: easy and difficult. In both the levels, the game lasted until the player lost all their lives. Lives were lost every time the mole moved without the player touching it. To create a harder level, we added more holes and a villain sprite that caused a life to be lost if it was touched. Overall, my partner and I worked very well, and after having experience from the Scratch project, I was able to create a product that I am proud of.</p>

          <h4>Scratch Project</h4>
          <h1>Plumber Brothers Game</h1>
          <h6>September 2019, Computer Science Principles</h6>
          <p>The scratch project was an introductory project to establish the basics of coding. In this project, I pair programmed for the first time, which taught me about some aspects of team dynamics in coding projects. The objective of this project was to make either a story animation of a game, and my partner and I decided on making a game inspired by the Mario Brothers. As this project had little restrictions and it’s main purpose was to get used to coding, my partner and I felt free to be very creative. To add plot to our story, we animated a beginning sequence to show a princess being stolen by an evil turtle. Before the last level, the player must jump on bricks, avoid holes, and pass the mini-villains which are usually mushrooms. In the last level, if all the obstacles and the turtle are defeated, the princess is freed from imprisonment and the characters get a happy ending. This project was short and while creating it I had beginner skills,  however, creating this app formed an integral part of my foundation in coding and I am pleased with the end product my partner and I created.
