          <p>Computers have always been a source of curiosity for me. As a little kid, I would always wonder, "How do computers work?" or "What is really happening when I use the internet?". As my curiosity grew, I started to teach myself the basics of computer science, and I realized my dream is to enter the computer science field when I grow up. To gain a structured understanding of computer science, I enrolled in Computer Science Principles as my freshman elective. Currently, I am in the Engineering Academy at Dublin High School and am enrolled in Principles of Engineering as a part of the computer science pathway. I plan to continue learning more about computer science throughout high school and eventually go to college as a computer science major.<br><br>Through my life experiences, I have become intelligent, self-motivated, and a natural leader. Growing up, I have always valued hard work, and a result of this value is my drive to better myself and gain knowledge. By my own accord, I enrolled in rigorous courses throughout high school to challenge myself. Being in more difficult classes has taught me to put my best effort into everything I do and the classes I struggled in made me smarter because they presented more opportunities to learn from my mistakes. As a student, I have a lot of experience with group work, especially in engineering courses, in which I usually take the role of a project manager in the many group projects I do. Through trials and tribulations, I have learned how to be the best leader I can be, one that balances in the middle of being too controlling or too passive. Overall, the characteristics I have gained have helped me excel in and out of school, and as I continue my journey, I will further develop and gain new skills and characteristics.
          <br><br>I am currently a sophomore in high school and I am pursuing an advanced scholar diploma. So far, I have achieved a 4.5  GPA for the first semester of my sophomore year and I plan to maintain high grades throughout the rest of my high school career. Also, while in high school, I joined a club for the Foundation for International Medical Relief of Children, an organization to provide medical care to people around the world who need it. Since the coronavirus pandemic, distance learning has had its difficulties but I have managed to keep up with my school work and activities. This year, I joined the Girls Who Code club to continue learning about coding and participate with other students that have the same interest in computers as me. I plan to return to school in person next year as a junior and am looking forward to seeing my peers and hopefully getting more volunteer and work experience as things open up again.
<br><br>In conclusion, I am still very young, and I am hopeful for the outlook of my future and the opportunities I will have to thrive. Thank you for reading my “About Me” page and please continue exploring my website.
