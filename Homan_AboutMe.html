          <p>Computers have always been a source of curiosity for me. As a little kid, I would always wonder, "How do computers work?" or "What is really happening when I use the internet?". As my curiosity grew, I started to teach myself the basics of computer science, and I realized I want to enter the computer science field when I grow up. To gain a structured understanding of computer science, I enrolled in Computer Science Principles as my freshman elective. Currently, I am in the Engineering Academy at Dublin High School and am enrolled in Computer Science Applications as a part of the computer science pathway. I plan to continue learning more about computer science throughout high school and eventually go to college as a computer science major.<br><br>

Through my life experiences, I have become intelligent, self-motivated, and a natural leader. Growing up, I have always valued hard work, and a result of this value is my drive to better myself and gain knowledge. By my own accord, I enrolled in rigorous courses throughout high school to challenge myself. Being in more difficult classes has taught me to put my best effort into everything I do. As a student, I have a lot of experience with group work, especially in engineering courses, in which I usually take the role of a project manager in the many group projects I do. Through trials and tribulations, I have learned how to be the best leader I can be, one that balances in the middle of being too controlling or too passive. Overall, the characteristics I have gained have helped me excel in and out of school, and as I continue my journey, I will further develop and gain new skills and characteristics.<br><br>

I am currently a junior in high school and I have many other interests and extracurriculars other than engineering. One of my biggest passions is music and my favorite class is AP Music Theory. In my free time, I like to listen to alternative rock, dream pop, folk, and pop music. I play the piano, drums, guitar, and bass, but the piano is by far my favorite instrument. I also enjoy reading and writing, making English one of my favorite classes as well. I am constantly reading and some of my favorite books are The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath and Eileen by Ottessa Moshfegh. Additionally, I am a member of the Dublin High School track and field team as a thrower for shotput and discus. I also really enjoy tennis and I hope to join the school’s tennis team when I am a senior. Lastly, one of my favorite extracurricular activities is that I am a mentor in Dublin High School’s freshman mentoring program. I love spending time with the underclassmen, getting to know new people through the program, and being able to help the freshmen that struggle with high school.<br><br>
