          <p>Computers have always been a source of curiosity for me. As a little kid, I would always wonder, "How do computers work?" or "What is really happening when I use the internet?". As my curiosity grew, I started to teach myself the basics of computer science, and I realized my dream is to enter the computer science field when I grow up. To gain a structured understanding of computer science, I enrolled in Computer Science Principles as my freshman elective. I plan to continue learning more about computer science throughout highschool and eventually go to college as a computer science major. <br><br>Through my life experiences, I have become intelligent, self-motivated, and a natural leader. Growing up, I have always valued hard work, and a result of this value is my drive to better myself and gain knowledge. By my own accord, I enrolled in more rigorous courses to challenge myself. Being in more difficult classes has taught me to put my best effort into everything I do and ultimately, the classes I struggled in more made me smarter because it presented more opportunities to learn from my mistakes. As a student, I have a lot of experience with group work. Through trials and tribulations, I have learned how to be the best leader I can be, one that balances in the middle of being too controlling or too passive. Overall, the characteristics I have gained have helped me excel in and out of school, and as I continue my journey, I will further develop and gain new skills and characteristics.
          <br><br>I am currently a freshman in high school and I am pursuing an advanced scholar diploma. In the little time I have been in high school, I have already achieved a 4.0 GPA for the first semester and I plan to maintain high grades throughout the rest of my high school career. Also, while in high school, I joined a club for the Foundation for International Medical Relief of Children, an organization to provide medical care to people around the world who need it. Recently, schools all over the world have been closing, including my own high school. Distance learning has proved to be a challenge to everyone involved, but it is just one of the many challenges that are bound to happen in a lifetime. While in quarantine, I have been keeping up with my school work and trying to be as productive as possible. On the bright side, I have taken this opportunity to better myself by pursuing more of my hobbies such as playing the drums and bass, skateboarding, and running. Although those aspects of quarantine have been fun, I miss being in school and I am extremely looking forward to returning in fall as a sophomore.<br><br>In conclusion, I am still very young, and I am hopeful for the outlook of my future and the opportunities I will have to thrive. Thank you for reading my “About Me” page and please continue exploring my website.
