          <p><br>As a member of the Dublin High School Engineering and Design Academy, I have been given opportunities to explore careers that I am interested in. The Engineering Academy sets up many field trips and guest speakers each year, and I have attended many of them because of my desire to learn about the many pathways there are in STEM.<br><br> <h3>Guest Speakers</h3><h4>Chevron - 04/20</h4>As I was taking my very first computer science class, I had the opportunity to hear from a panel of software engineers that worked for Chevron. These guest speakers shared what a typical day in the life is for a software engineer and afforded me a better understanding of what it means to code for a profession. I enjoyed hearing about the common practices within teams of software engineers such as following the SCRUM work strategy that involves small ‘sprints’ that teams tackle one at a time until a project is completed.<br><br><h4>Trisha Shah - 03/21</h4>Trisha Shah is a DHS engineering academy alumni who graciously came as a guest speaker to share her post-high school experiences. Trisha shared her experiences attending San Jose State University, and her subsequent jobs at Apple and Amazon MarketPlace. One of the most interesting things about this talk was that Trisha is a part of an upcoming field of CS called management information systems that is more customer-facing and less scientific because you work directly with the clients seeking software.<br><br><h4>Grace Ermie - 04/21</h4>Grace Ermie is a guest speaker who works as a software engineer with a focus in the environment and machine learning. Gracie works as a part of a project that uses machine learning to track the migration of whales, thus helping to prevent their extinction. She was currently developing algorithms that could not only track the paths of whales, but also assess their health. Grace Ermie’s talk was inspiring to me as it expanded my mind on the ways that computer science can be utilized.<br><br><h4>Kathleen Morse - 04/22</h4>Kathleen Morse is an impressive guest speaker who came to share her experiences as a material engineer with a focus on space. Kathleen attended Stanford and MIT, and is now a majority shareholder Yosemite Space, allowing her more creative freedom in her work. Kathleen’s current projects are on the use of silicon materials for space travel.<br><br><br><h3>Field Trips</h3><h4>Google Talk with Kari Byron</h4>As a freshman, I had the wonderful experience of going to the Google Campus to watch a talk with Kari Byron about her new show Crash Test World. Kari Byron is known for her previous work on MythBusters, and her new show was about exploring the culmination of history, technology, and culture across the world. This field trip was for the women in the engineering academy and this was a great way to hear from an inspiring woman who urged us to explore the world and our passions.<br><br><h4>Lawrence Livermore National Lab Computing Job Shadow - 02/21</h4>Growing up in the East Bay Area, it has always been great to be around the Lawrence Livermore National Lab(LLNL) because of the groundbreaking work they do. In this virtual field trip, I got a peek inside the government funded lab that worked to ensure our national security. The lab operates on a 24-hour basis and has a multi-billion dollar impact on the economy.<br><br><h4>Roche Careers Session - 02/21</h4>The Roche Careers Session gave me great new insight into the world of bio-engineering.With this field trip taking place in the midst of the pandemic, it was very interesting to hear how these engineers were responding to a global emergency. I learned about how they combined computer science, data science, and bio-analytics to create a new diagnostics test for COVID-19. They also gave us a demo of the steps in which they handled going into a lab during the pandemic while trying to make a vaccine, which was very cool to see.<br><br><h4>Dig Deep Farms - 02/22</h4>Dig Deep Farms is a local farm chain in the Bay Area that focuses on permaculture, or the conscious design and implementation of agriculture that utilizes the natural ecosystem. This field trip was a very interesting opportunity to see successful community organization in real life. This farm does many programs to give back, such as internships to people with criminal records and free food banks. On top of this, they use many high-tech techniques to ensure that their farming is environmentally friendly by modifying how they use pesticides and water distribution.<br><br>
