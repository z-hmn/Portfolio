          <p><br>As a member of the Dublin High School Engineering and Design Academy, I have been given opportunities to explore careers that I am interested in. The Engineering Academy sets up many field trips and guest speakers each year, and I have attended many of them because of my desire to learn about the many pathways there are in STEM.<br><br>One of the field trips I went to was at the Google Campus to attend a Google Talk from Kari Byron. Kari Byron is most well known for her time on the show “MythBusters”, but this talk was about her new documentary-style show, Crash Test World. In her show, she travels the world to examine culture, science, history, and technology, and I was able to see a preview of the show on this field trip. One of the things I learned from Crash Test World and Byron’s talk is the intersectionality of culture and science and the many ways it can affect the world. After her talk, I was able to have a conversation with her about the struggles of going into the STEM field as a woman. One of the best parts of this trip was simply being able to see the Google workspace and its workers existing in that environment. I’ve always dreamt of working at tech companies such as Google, and to see it for my own eyes was very impressive and gave insight to the typical day for workers at high-tech companies in the Silicon Valley.<br><br>While I was in Computer Science Principles, I have had the opportunity to hear from many professionals that work in the field of computer science, the field I was most interested in. One of the guest speakers from earlier in the year worked for Chevron and he shared a lot of insightful information. Some of the important information I pulled away from that talk is the difference between Corporate IT and working for a company that’s product is software. He also shared the typical teamwork that is done at software engineering jobs, and I realized that these jobs are versatile as the team members switch jobs a lot. Another guest speaker that stood out was a man who worked for the NFL. From his presentation, I mostly learned about the different technologies that are used for computers and how innovative workers need to be to solve technological problems. Both of these guest speakers inspired me by helping me realize how many options there are in the field of computer science, which opened my horizons much more compared to how I used to view computer science jobs.
