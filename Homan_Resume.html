          <p>As a freshman who has only been recently accepted into the Engineering Academy, I do not have a lot of field trip experiences. However, I was luckily able to attend a field trip at the Google campus before the quarantine started. This field trip was a great experience as we were able to attend a Google Talk from Kari Byron. On this excursion, I learned about Kari Byron’s new documentary-style show, Crash Test World. After her talk, I was able to have a conversation with her about the struggles of going into the STEM field as a girl. One of the best parts of this trip was simply being able to see the Google workspace and its workers existing in that environment. I’ve always dreamt of working at tech companies such as Google, and to see it for my own eyes was very impressive and gave insight to the typical day for workers at high-tech companies in the Silicon Valley.<br><br>In Computer Science Principles, I have had the opportunity to hear from many professionals that work in the field of computer science. One of the guest speakers from earlier in the year worked for Chevron and he shared a lot of insightful information. Some of the important information I pulled away from that talk is the difference between Corporate IT and working for a company that’s product is software. He also shared the typical teamwork that is done at software engineering jobs, and I realized that these jobs are versatile as the team members switch jobs a lot. Another guest speaker that stood out was a man who worked for the NFL. From his presentation, I mostly learned about the different technologies that are used for computers and how innovative workers need to be to solve technological problems. Both of these guest speakers inspired me by helping me realize how many options there are in the field of computer science, which opened my horizons much more compared to how I used to view computer science jobs.<br><br>Due to only being a Freshman in high school, I have not had many opportunities to work. One of the jobs I have had is being a child care provider. I have supervised up to 4 children at a time from the ages of two to eight. During this job, I learned how to be more responsible and vigilant to keep others safe. Being a babysitter has allowed me to practice leadership, as I have to lead the children but do it in a way that isn’t too controlling or bossy. Also, it has improved my communication skills because I have to organize and clarify with parents as well as communicate with toddlers effectively. Also, I have done volunteer work at an organization called MedShare. This volunteer work consisted of packaging medical supplies to send to third-world countries that do not have enough medical support. This job built my teamwork skills because I worked in groups of people and was practice for following directions as the packing instructions were strict. Overall, the work experience I have already had has shaped me into a great worker, however, there is still a lot more room to improve as I get more experience throughout the rest of my life.
